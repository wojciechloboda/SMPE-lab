### Quality of Presentation (Clarity, Structure)

The document is clear and well-structured. It is easy to follow. The explanations provided are understandable.

### Technical Quality

The first graph appears correct.  
The second graph is also accurate, properly using two Y-axes.  
The third graph is clear and correctly calculated.

However, there is no graph comparing wheat prices and salaries on two axis without an explicit time axis. Representing time differently, as suggested in the topic description, could provide additional insights.

Overall, the calculations seem correct, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis appear accurate. That said, the third point regarding the creation of alternative graph representations was not completed as suggested.

### Reproducibility

All code for generating the graphs and performing the analysis is provided and generally well-written. However, since the analysis is implemented as a JavaScript script rather than a computational document, following the workflow exactly as intended is challenging.

Data sources are properly documented, with both links and copies included in the repository.

Unfortunately, the processing steps are not automated. Running the code without consulting the README is difficult, and I encountered compilation issues and missing libraries. The required libraries are not clearly defined, which further complicates reproducibility.

### Relevance

The author successfully included the most important figures from the analysis and was able to reproduce the conclusions of the original study. However, not all requested graphs were provided, and the analysis of which data representation is clearest was not performed.

The work was not extended beyond the initial requirements. 

## Conclusion 

Overall, the analysis covers the most critical components. Nevertheless, the choice to use JavaScript without a computational document format makes it challenging to fully reproduce the author’s computations.
